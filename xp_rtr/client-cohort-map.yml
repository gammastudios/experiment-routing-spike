# a service has experiments
# an experiment has treatments
# a cohort is assigned to a treatment
# a client is assigned to a cohort
# constraint: a client can only be assigned to one cohort per service
# currently defined such that a service uses 1 single cohort strategy however, provided a given client 
#   only ever is allocated to one treatment across experiments in a service, it is possible to have 
#   differing cohort strategies for different experiments within the same service.  This enables a lookup
#   of treatment using a key of `[ service-name, client-id ]`
